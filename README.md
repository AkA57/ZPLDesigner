# ZPLDesigner
## Description
ZPLDesigner is a free and easy-to-use software utility that allows you to create, preview and print label based on Zebra Programming Language (ZPL).

## Features
### ZPL commands
ZPL Designer can help you to write ZPL code. The left panel provides a list of the main ZPL commands used to design a label.
By hovering the mouse pointer over the desired ZPL command, a detailled description will be displayed on the top "Help" panel. Clicking on it will add this command to the ZPL editor.

### Preview and Print
By pressing F5 or clicking on Preview button, ZPL Designer will display the result of you ZPL code on the Preview tab. You will be able to zoom/unzoom, rotate or save the generated label as an image.

An industrial ZPL printer with embedded website and network is required for this feature. Enter the IP address of the printer on the top menu and click on the two arrows to connect. You are now able to use the print and preview functions.

### Label format
Display label format on preview tab by selected a standard or custom label format.
